[2] how to run:

	!!!! make sure run reciever firstly before running sender !!!!


	1. run reciever:

			./reciever


	2. run sender

			./sender msg



[3] something you need to know:

	when you run the reciever, it will creat 8 files named from 0 to 7,
also it will make 3 flag files, which named flag1,flag2,flag3.

	you can change files dir by changing macro "BASE_DIR" in "common.h",
	
	you also should make sure the files in BASE_DIR will allow other users to
access,reading at least. 
	you can change file-mode such as follow:

		chmod 755 BASE_DIR  && chmod 755 BASE_DIR/*
